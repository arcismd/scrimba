				<h2>Meta-Pigeon Sneaker NFT $33,000</h2>

				<p><strong>At $33k, this NFT sneaker is super good value!</strong></p>
				<p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a 
					great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic 
					value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT 
					bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. 
					Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="">crafting an NFT</a> and by 
					this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>

				<h2>For the true Crypto-connoisseur</h2>

				<p>Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk 
					(left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a 
					total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS 
					Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text 
					on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.</p>

				<p>Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're selling 
					them, not buying them.</p>
